# Autonomous Drone Navigation using Large Language Models

## Description
This project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to autonomously control drones. The LLM interprets commands, plans flight paths, and navigates drones through complex environments. The project includes modules for natural language processing, drone control, and real-time environmental analysis.

## Features
- **Natural Language Command Processing:** Understand and interpret flight commands.
- **Path Planning:** Generate optimized flight paths.
- **Real-time Navigation:** Adjust drone paths based on live environmental data.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Identify and avoid obstacles.
- **Simulated and Real-World Deployment:** Test in a simulated environment and deploy on real drones.
